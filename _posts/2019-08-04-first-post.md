A personal website has been long overdue. A few days ago I pushed myself to create this website. I borrowed a publicly available template and made some changes and put it up on Github.

Today, I tried adding posts to the website and I am writing my first post now. In the process, I learnt a bit of Jekyll and Markdown. Going forward, I plan to write about my research in this space.
